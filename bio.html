    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> Salpingopharyngeus is currently a student at Tufts University where he is pursing his masters degree in Computer
        science. He posesses a diverse set of academic interests, and to this end previously studied human development
        at the Universty of California, Davis where he also learned about soilless horticultre while serving as a intern
        at the
        Lieth Lab at UC Davis.</p>
    <p>Having personally seen the lack of medical availability at a very early age, both as a home health aide for the
        elderly, and later as an intern at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center, Salpingopharyngeus hopes
        to attend medical school, and use his unique experiences and perspective to positively impact the health of
        impoverished
        communities and third world countries by bridge the gap between medicine and computers in the hopes of
        reducing negative patient outcomes and making quality healthcare more accessible to underserved communities</p>
    <p> In addition to his many academic interests, Salpingopharyngeus is also a classically musician, with an empasis
        in piano performance. Presently, he continues to volunteer his free time to develop the
        conservatory’s yearly curriculum and maintain the school’s online presence. Despite his many academic pursuits,
        he still finds the time to routinely stop by the conservatory to guest lecture in classes, perform at social
        functions and for the elderly. He also assists in organizing the yearly youth summer arts program for the
        community at large, and is investigating the use of artifical intelligence to decode medival numes that have
        been lost to time. </p>
    <p> Salpingopharyngeus has proven to be a calm leader in crisis situations and resolutions are often found as result
        of his natural talent for seeing the bigger picture. When working within a team, his peers describe him as a
        creative individual with a great skill in solving complicated problems—often with novel or innovative
        solutions—that lead to team success</p>
    <p> Fun Fact: Salpingopharyngeus was one of the longest words I learned while studying anatomy. It's responsible
        helps in swallowing allows you to pop your ears when flying or diving.
